# Week Four
## IT Session - Monday 10/02/2025

### During Session
- I created the Department model and the CRUD pages for it as well.
- During this session I also set up our initial branches for the repository.
- I spoke with our TA on different ways to setup our database. He showed me how to use Azure so we could have an online DB, and I made an account and began looking into how to setup

## Group Meeting 1 - Tuesday 11/02/2025

### During Session
- This session was mainly surrounding fixing our github issues. We had run into some issues where the repository wasn't using .gitignore as a base file, so we decided to rework the repository and create a new one and transfer our code done on monday to this one. For this, me and Jacob briefly looked into what to put into the base .gitignore so we could ignore the .vs files, as well as the .obj and .bin files. We ended up fixing this but Jacob still had some issues with files not being accepted in the github pull requests so he fixed this on his own at home. 
- Merged department-setup into role-setup so Jacob could merge both into roles-setup for Jasmine to construct her CRUD when he fixed the issue he was encountering with the files.

### To do
Completed all for this session

### Issues
No conflicts during this session, but we encountered a lot of issues with the repository for Jacobs branch. As this didn't affect mine or Liana's work, Jacob did it independantly at home. Most of our week went into ensuring this was completely sorted so we don't encounter issues during our sprint.

## Group Meeting 2 - Thursday 13/02/2025

### During Session
- I completed my Controller for the department-setup and pushed that to my branch in our repo.

### To do
Setup Azure DB over the weekend so we can use it for our sprint week.
