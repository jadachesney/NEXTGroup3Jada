# Week Seven
## IT Session - Monday 17/03/2025

### During Session
- Me and Jasmine worked on merging all the completed CSS in this session. We spent the entire session on this due to having multiple branches and pages that needed merging and on github we had a lot of merge conflicts. Once we merged these pages together (I solved the conflicts through GitHub) we then went through and ensured all the CSS was working fine. We noticed that the navbar had slightly messed up therefore we worked on fixing it together.
- Arian helped us a bit during this session as well with the merge conflicts but in the end I just ended up handling them myself as I knew the code quite well.

### To Do
Completed all for this session

### Issues
No conflicts this session

## Group Meeting 1 - Tuesday 18/03/2025

### During Session
- Me and Jasmine began the login system. We decided to devise this into two parts. As the Staff and Candidate needed a login, we decided I'd do the staff login and she'd do the candidate login. The backend and front-end for these were going to be very similar, the only difference being extra verification for staff. So Jasmine started working on the Candidate backend while I did the front end. I did the CSS and HTML in this session, and added it to the Candidate login page as well. I slightly tweaked this so for Staff it asks for Staff ID input and Candidate does not. 
- I added test candidate and staff for the login, and gave them a password and email.

### To do
- Backend for staff login system
- Create a register page for candidates 

### Issues
No conflicts
