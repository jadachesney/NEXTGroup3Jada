# Week Six
## IT Session - Monday 24/02/2025

### During Session
- I added more range based questions to the database. Liana offered input on the wording of some, though I queryed these and added them entirely.
- We mainly spent this session discussing last weeks sprint and how we'd change some things for the next one. The main point brought up was better allocation of tasks to utilise our time better.

## Group Meeting 1 - Tuesday 25/02/2025

### During Session
- I created the landing page wireframe. I did so using Figma, and I created it by myself inspired by the NEXT Careers landing page. Liana helped me find the mp4 that NEXT used on their website, though this was not used this week, so I made the wireframe by myself and planned to use that video next week.
