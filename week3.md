## Group Meeting 1 - Tuesday 04/02/2025

### During Session
- Me and Liana started the C4 context diagram. We used our use case diagram to model the system ad all its users. Then we added the relationship between them all so its easy to view.
- As a group, we came up with some starting questions in relation to the departments. Me and Liana grouped up to create 4 questions that targeted each department, and then discussed how the values would be assigned to them. So for instance, a question like "I am analytical" would +8 the IT and Finance department, and would attribute points to other departments depending on how strongly related they were to the question. We used the research I had done in the first two weeks to base these questions.
- The questions in specific we created related to being detail-oriented, collaborative, being familiar with web design, and being a leader. Each of these targeted certain departments and pitted others against each other in order for us to make sure we get an unbiased reading.
- Me and Liana discussed the admin role being able to add, remove, and edit a new role to the database. So if there is a new role being added to the NEXT careers system, it will ask for the role name, department in which it belongs, and a description which will be used for the text-based questions.

### To do
- Finish C4 diagrams
- Discuss coding plan for next week

## Group Meeting 2 - Thursday 06/02/2025

### During Session
- Me and Liana began finishing the C4 Context diagram from the previous meeting. As we had tweaked the use-case diagram to add more admin permissions, we reflected these changes in the admin user in the context diagram.
- Me and Liana also decided on removing the "Finish Questionnaire" from the use-case diagram as "View Results" was technically the finish action therefor it was unneeded.
- Discussed coding plan for next week. We assigned who was going to start each code for the MVC. I am doing the Department model and controller.
