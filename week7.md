## Group Meeting 1 - Tuesday 04/03/2025

### During Session
- We addressed an issue that some of the text-based answers (which I hadn't written previously, I created range based) came off a bit odd-sounding. So for this session I went through all (approx.,) 45 questions and rewrote them to be more specific to a role or department, alongside making them more user friendly. I then queryed these all back into the database.

## Group Meeting 2 - Wednesday 05/03/2025

### During Session
- I created the landing page for the website. Though it isn't finished yet, I did the CSS styling and used the video found from last week to incorporate onto the landing page. The only issue I encountered when making this landing page was that Blazor/Bootstrap kept overwriting my custom css. This was an issue due to me not being familiar with Bootstrap and overall, not preferring it, so I had to go through the prebuilt Bootstrap and remove the !important tag so my CSS was the primary.

### To do
Finish up small things with the landing page.
